# Python OOP Demo

This project demonstrates how to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in **Python**.  
It covers everything from simple classes and inheritance to advanced topics like dataclasses, descriptors, decorators, magic methods, and common design patterns.

Each example is contained in its own file inside the project structure for easy navigation and learning.

## Overview

Python OOP allows you to structure your programs around objects — entities that hold data **and** behavior.  
This project shows how Python implements OOP step-by-step using **real, commented examples**, similar to the C# demo project.

Examples are organized into:

- **basics/**
- **advanced/**
- **patterns/**

Each file demonstrates a specific concept in isolation so you can open, run, and study them individually.

## Features Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Classes** | Basic class definitions, attributes, and methods. |
| **Inheritance** | Base and derived classes, overriding, polymorphism. |
| **Encapsulation** | Protected (`_var`) and private (`__var`) attributes, `@property`. |
| **Abstract Classes** | Using `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod` to define required behavior. |
| **Dataclasses** | Automatic constructor, defaults, immutability (`frozen=True`). |
| **Decorators** | Function wrappers, timing, logging, authorization, method decorators. |
| **Descriptors** | Custom attribute behavior (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__`). |
| **Magic Methods** | Operator overloading, `__repr__`, `__str__`, containers, context managers. |
| **Singleton Pattern** | Multiple implementations: classic, decorator, metaclass, thread-safe. |
| **Factory Pattern** | Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory. |
| **Strategy Pattern** | Swappable algorithms at runtime (OOP and functional styles). |
| **Observer Pattern** | Subject/Observer and Pythonic event/callback system. |
