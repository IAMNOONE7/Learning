# C# OOP Demo

This project demonstrates how to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#.
It covers everything from simple classes and properties to advanced topics like inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and immutability.

---

## Overview

OOP allows you to structure your programs around objects — entities that hold data and behavior.
This project shows how C# implements OOP step by step using real, commented examples.

Each example is contained in its own file and is called from Program.cs for easy testing.

## Features Demonstrated

| Concept                        | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Properties**            | Simplified syntax using `get; set;` without manual fields           |
| **Full Properties**            | Custom `get` and `set` logic for validation or computed values      |
| **Private Setters**            | Restrict modification from outside the class                        |
| **Computed Properties**        | Properties returning calculated values (no storage)                 |
| **Encapsulation**              | Hiding data and exposing safe methods (`BankAccount`)               |
| **Inheritance**                | Base and derived classes (`Device` - `MotorDevice`)                 |
| **Abstract Classes**           | Shared logic and required implementations for derived types         |
| **Interfaces**                 | Define multiple behaviors (`IConnectable`, `IServiceable`)          |
| **Immutability**               | Read-only objects with constructor initialization (`ImmutableUser`) |
| **Instance vs Static Methods** | Demonstrates difference using `Calculator` class                    |
